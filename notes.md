learning the merge/sort algorithm
6 ways to sort
Naive sorts 1-3 On2 not efficient consider all items
1. Selection sort
2. Insertion
3. Bubble Sort
Efficient Sort n logn
4. Merge sort
Break array into smaller and smaller pieces
compare items to each other
use pointer method to compare first index of each array
use recursion to break arrays into 1 (recursion is the idea of repeating the current running function until a condition is met, so the condition is that there needs to only be array with length of 1 else split it)
5. Heap sort
6. qUick sort
